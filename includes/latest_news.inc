<p>Version 0.69 of OpenGuides was released on the weekend, with
changes focusing on the administrative "missing metadata" tool.  New
metadata types have been added to the missing metadata search form,
allowing people to search for pages with, for example, no associated
image.  In addition, these search results can now be viewed on a map
as an extra option to the previous "list" view.</p>

<p>Under-the-hood changes made as part of this enhancement will also
make it easier in the future for us to allow visualisation of even
more types of search result on a map.</p>
