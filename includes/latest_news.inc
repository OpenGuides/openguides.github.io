<p>Version 0.66 of OpenGuides was released yesterday by our new CPAN release
manager, Bob Walker.  This includes various usability fixes, new CSS hooks,
and a switch to Geo::Coordinates::* modules rather than the old 
Geography::NationalGrid::* ones (which no longer exist on CPAN).</p>

<p>We now require version 2.24 of Template (for its text virtual methods,
needed to create the abovementioned CSS hooks).</p>
