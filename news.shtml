<p>Version 0.67 of OpenGuides was released today, with several major
changes and bugfixes.</p>

<p>We now use <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> as
our JavaScript mapping library, with OpenStreetMap and MapQuest tiles
as default.  JSON output has been added or improved on several types
of pages, including index pages and user preferences.  A basic
stylesheet is now included in the distribution, and a long-standing
recent changes bug has been fixed.  Finally, it's now possible to
index on category and locale at the same time (so you can view e.g. a
list or map of all pubs in Holborn).</p>

<p>Version 0.66 of OpenGuides was released yesterday by our new CPAN release
manager, Bob Walker.  This includes various usability fixes, new CSS hooks,
and a switch to Geo::Coordinates::* modules rather than the old 
Geography::NationalGrid::* ones (which no longer exist on CPAN).</p>

<p>We now require version 2.24 of Template (for its text virtual methods,
needed to create the abovementioned CSS hooks).</p>

<p>Version 0.64 of OpenGuides was released this week, with various
small bugfixes and improvements including slightly simpler
installation, plus metadata discovery, JSON support, an optional admin
navbar, and host whitelisting for editing moderated nodes.</p>

<p>Apologies for the long delay since the last bit of news here; we
<i>were</i> doing things, honest, but because of the way the website was set
up, it was a faff to update.  This has now been fixed!</p>

href="http://oxford.openguides.org/">Oxford</a> this time, on Saturday 18
October and Sunday 19 October 2008.  Many more details can be found <a
