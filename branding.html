title: Branding Guidelines

 		<h1>Using the Name</h1>
 	<p>
 	We count our brand as the premiere of our corporate assets. Our brand and
 	corporate identity have immeasurable value; their utility increases each time
 	it they are presented properly and decreases with every incorrect or improper
 	application. Brand attributes define OpenGuides, and accurate and consistent use
 	of our trademarks is vital to protect the OpenGuides corporate identity. When
	it is presented consistently, we create a positive and lasting impression of our
 	company. It is your responsibility to comply with the most current version of
 	these guidelines.
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	...Just kidding.
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	In reality, we have a pretty relaxed approach to the application of the
 	OpenGuides name. It can be summed up as follows:
 	</p>
 	<ol>
 	        <li>If you set up a city guide and would like to be part of our
 	guide network, please link to openguides.org from your site's front page.
 	Using the words "the OpenGuides network" somewhere would be ideal.</li>
 	        <li>It's "OpenGuides" for the project name, but "The Open Guide
 	to..." when it comes to naming Guides. On the other hand, your site
 	doesn't have to be called "the Open Guide to Wherever"; you can name it
 	whatever you like. Do what suits you best.</li>
 	        <li>If you're using our software for another purpose, please mention on
 	the front page that your site's powered by OpenGuides, and have a link to us.</li>
	</ol>
 	<p>
 	That's it - thanks!
 	</p>
