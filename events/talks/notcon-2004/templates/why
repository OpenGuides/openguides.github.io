<ul>
	<li>Ever needed to find...
	<ul>
		<li>A pub or restaurant</li>
		<li>A train station</li>
		<li>A street, or building</li>
		<li><em>Or,</em> what people think of any of the above</li>
		<li>And (most importantly?) without popups, flashing banner ads and junk?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Or perhaps wanted to be able to discuss and review your city? We did.</li>
	<li>In the pub: "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a wiki about London?"</li>
	<li>So we made one....</li>
