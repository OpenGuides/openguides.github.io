  <li>Sometimes you want to find:
  <ul>
    <li>a bar or restaurant</li>
    <li>a train station</li>
    <li>a street, or perhaps a building</li>
    <li>and, most importantly, what people think about it</li>
    <li>(<em>Without</em> popups, flashing banner ads, and "editorials" from
people who are paid to tell you things are great, even if they're not.)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Or you might want to share your own opinions about your city.</li>
  <li>In discussion, we decided a wiki about London would be useful.</li>
