<ul>
	<li>Ever needed to find...
	<ul>
		<li>A pub or restaurant?</li>
		<li>A train station?</li>
		<li>A street? A building?</li>
		<li>Or what people think of any of the above, and more?</li>
		<li>And <em>without</em> popups, flashing banner ads and junk?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Ever wanted to be able to discuss and review your city?</li>
	<li>We did.</li>
	<li>In the pub: "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a wiki about London?"
	<li>So we made one.</li>
