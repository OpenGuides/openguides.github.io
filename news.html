<p>Version 0.71 of OpenGuides was released yesterday.  The main
user-visible change is that category/locale index maps now have the
scale superimposed on the map.  There are also several Debian-related
fixes to the tests and the install process.</p>

<p>In addition, the OpenGuides code repository has been moved from svn
<a href="https://github.com/OpenGuides/OpenGuides">to github</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Version 0.70 of OpenGuides was released yesterday.  The changes
include an upgrade to version 0.4 of the Leaflet mapping library; this
was done in order to allow use of <a
href="https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins">Pavel Shramov's
Leaflet plugins</a> (in particular, the Google satellite view plugin
used on <a href="http://croydon.randomness.org.uk/">the Completists'
Guide to Croydon</a>).</p>

<p>The other main changes are to do with formatting and display of
node content.  External links are now given a class of "external",
rather than being formatted with hardcoded square brackets.  New
elements are allowed in page content: span, dl, dt, and dd.  Finally,
a new macro has been added &#8212; @INDEX_LIST_NO_PREFIX &#8212; which
gives a list of things in a given category or locale but leaves off
the "Category" or "Locale" prefix for any subcategories/sublocales in
that list.</p>

<p>Version 0.69 of OpenGuides was released on the weekend, with
changes focusing on the administrative "missing metadata" tool.  New
metadata types have been added to the missing metadata search form,
allowing people to search for pages with, for example, no associated
image.  In addition, these search results can now be viewed on a map
as an extra option to the previous "list" view.</p>

<p>Under-the-hood changes made as part of this enhancement will also
make it easier in the future for us to allow visualisation of even
more types of search result on a map.</p>

<p>Version 0.67 of OpenGuides was released today, with several major
changes and bugfixes.</p>

<p>We now use <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/">Leaflet</a> as
our JavaScript mapping library, with OpenStreetMap and MapQuest tiles
as default.  JSON output has been added or improved on several types
of pages, including index pages and user preferences.  A basic
stylesheet is now included in the distribution, and a long-standing
recent changes bug has been fixed.  Finally, it's now possible to
index on category and locale at the same time (so you can view e.g. a
list or map of all pubs in Holborn).</p>

<p>Version 0.66 of OpenGuides was released yesterday by our new CPAN release
manager, Bob Walker.  This includes various usability fixes, new CSS hooks,
and a switch to Geo::Coordinates::* modules rather than the old 
Geography::NationalGrid::* ones (which no longer exist on CPAN).</p>

<p>We now require version 2.24 of Template (for its text virtual methods,
needed to create the abovementioned CSS hooks).</p>

<p>Version 0.64 of OpenGuides was released this week, with various
small bugfixes and improvements including slightly simpler
installation, plus metadata discovery, JSON support, an optional admin
navbar, and host whitelisting for editing moderated nodes.</p>

<p>Apologies for the long delay since the last bit of news here; we
<i>were</i> doing things, honest, but because of the way the website was set
up, it was a faff to update.  This has now been fixed!</p>

<p>In other exciting news, we're having another hackfest!  It'll be in <a
href="http://oxford.openguides.org/">Oxford</a> this time, on Saturday 18
October and Sunday 19 October 2008.  Many more details can be found <a
