The OpenGuides system is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"
title="What is Free Software? (at gnu.org)">free software</a>, written in <a 
href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. It is available for <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenGuides/" style="font-weight: bold">download</a> 
from the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/"><acronym title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</acronym></a>.

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>
To run OpenGuides, you will need a webserver capable of running Perl, and
a number of Perl modules as prerequisites, all of which are also available 
from the CPAN. We recommend installing OpenGuides via <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN/">CPAN.pm</a> or the newer <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/">CPANPLUS.pm</a>, as these will
handle the installation of prerequisites for you. Alternatively, if you run a
<a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian GNU/Linux">Debian</a> system, you can install OpenGuides 
with "apt". Full details and packages are available at the <a
href="http://www.larted.org.uk/~dom/debian/openguides/">package home page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
We're still working on a decent piece of general documentation for
installing and running your own guide, and hope to have it available
as soon as possible. At present, you can read the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/src/DOM/OpenGuides-0.51/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
file that comes with the software for instructions on how to get it up and
running.
</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>
If you don't have your own webserver to run a Guide on, two people are kindly
offering to help out. In the UK, contact Dominic Hargreaves (dom(at)earth.li);
in the US, Christopher Schmidt (crschmidt(at)crschmidt.net).
