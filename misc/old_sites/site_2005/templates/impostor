<h1>False OpenGuides</h1>

It has been drawn to our attention that an individual in Scotland, one Neil
McKillop, is using our trademarks ("OpenGuides" and "The Open Guide to...") to 
run several websites which, while superficially similar to ours, are in no way 
connected with the OpenGuides Project. These include:

<ul>
  <li>openguide.co.uk, and the subdomains
  <ul>
    <li>scotland.openguide.co.uk</li>
    <li>aberdeen.openguide.co.uk</li>
    <li>edinburgh.openguide.co.uk</li>
    <li>glasgow.openguide.co.uk</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>openguides.co.uk, and the subdomains
  <ul>
    <li>scotland.openguides.co.uk</li>
    <li>aberdeen.openguides.co.uk</li>
    <li>edinburgh.openguides.co.uk</li>
    <li>glasgow.openguides.co.uk</li>
  </ul> (these resolve to the same as the openguide.co.uk URLs above.)</li>
</ul>

For example, the site glasgow.openguide.co.uk bills itself as "The Open
Guide to Glasgow", which is clearly intended to interfere with an OpenGuides
project, <a href="http://glasgow.openguides.org/">The Open Guide to
Glasgow</a>. Mr. McKillop's sites do not run the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/OpenGuides/">OpenGuides software</a>. They
are not affiliated with us in any way, shape or form.
<p>
As Mr. McKillop has not responded to any communications we have sent him, we
have attempted to have him cease these operations via <a
href="http://www.nominet.org.uk/">Nominet</a>'s <a 
href="http://www.nominet.org.uk/DisputeResolution/DrsProcedure/DrsProcedure.html">Dispute
Resolution Service</a>. However, unfortunately, due to what we can only
perceive as a flaw in the procedure, as Mr. McKillop has continued to not
respond, the burden would be on us in order for the process to continue. We
would have to pay Nominet the sum of &pound;880 so that one of their
"experts" could supervise the process. To quote an email they sent,
<p>
<blockquote>
If we do not receive your fees... we will deem your complaint to be withdrawn, 
and we will close our file on this matter.
</blockquote>
<p>
Dubious logic aside, this is something we simply can't afford to do.
We're a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free
Software</a> project, run, operated, and developed entirely by volunteers in
their spare time. We don't have money to spend on "experts" or lawyers. So,
although Neil McKillop is abusing our trademarks and the goodwill of those
who contribute to the OpenGuides project, we are effectively able to do
nothing about it. (Note: you can find correspondence on this matter in
<a href="/drs_files/">drs_files</a>.)
<p>
All we can ask that you do is to firstly keep your eyes and ears open: if
you find a reference to one of Mr. McKillop's sites, please either inform
the person in question what is going on, or tell us about it so that we can
get in touch; and, secondly, tell Mr. McKillop exactly how you feel about
it, by emailing him - either at <a
href="mailto:cmpadmin@nvmtech.co.uk">cmpadmin@nvmtech.co.uk</a> or <a
href="mailto:neil@mckillop.org">neil@mckillop.org</a>. If you have access to
<a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">Internet Relay Chat</a>, he has set up a
channel on irc.freenode.net called #openguide. Stop by and share your
opinion.
