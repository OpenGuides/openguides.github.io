<h1>How to search an Open Guide</h1>
<p>
This page outlines how to use the search facility on OpenGuides sites. If you 
have any feedback or tips, please send them to the <a href="/page/lists">developers' mailing
list</a>. Please also let us know if you are able to translate this page
into other languages.
</p>
<h2>Simple searches</h2>
<p>
Every page on an OpenGuides site contains a "Search" textbox. Entering a word 
into the search box will bring up a list of pages containing the word, much
like any search engine you're used to. The list of results will be divided
up into pages, each showing 20 results.
</p>
<h2>This <em>or</em> that searches</h2>
<p>
If you want to search for more than one thing but not necessarily all of
them, separate your search words by commas. So, a search for
</p>
<kbd class="search_example">restaurant, cafe</kbd>
<p>
will list you all pages containing either the word "restaurant" or the word "cafe".
</p>
<h2>"Group of words" searches</h2>
<p>
To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in double quotes. For example:
</p>
<kbd class="search_example">"pedestrian street"</kbd>
<p>
will get you the pages that contain the exact phrase "pedestrian street",
but not pages that contain something like "the pedestrian should avoid this
street".

<h3>A note on search scores</h3>
<p>
The results of your search are sorted by their scores, which appear next to
them. If you're interested, this is how they're worked out; otherwise, you
can skip this bit without worrying.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A match for your search in a page's title scores 10 points.</li>
  <li>A match in a page's category or locale scores 3 points.</li>
  <li>A match in a page's main content scores 1 point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These points are then added together. Pages matching in score are sorted by
title.
