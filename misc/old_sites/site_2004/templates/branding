We count our brand as the premiere of our corporate assets. Our brand and
corporate identity have immeasurable value; their utility increases each time
it they are presented properly and decreases with every incorrect or improper
application. Brand attributes define OpenGuides, and accurate and consistent use
of our trademarks is vital to protect the OpenGuides corporate identity. When
it is presented consistently, we create a positive and lasting impression of our
company. It is your responsibility to comply with the most current version of
these guidelines.

<em>Just kidding!</em>

In reality, we have a very relaxed approach to the application of the
OpenGuides name (note - one word, written with StudlyCaps). It can be summed
up as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you set up a city guide and would like to be part of our
guide network, please link to openguides.org from your site's front page.
Using the words "the OpenGuides network" somewhere would be ideal.</li>
	<li>If you're using our software for something other than that,
please mention on the front page that your site's powered by OpenGuides, and
have a link to <a href="?page=software">our downloads page</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it!
