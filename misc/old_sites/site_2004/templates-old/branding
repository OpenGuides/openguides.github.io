<h1>Our Branding Guidelines</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic">
We count our brand as the premiere of our corporate assets. Our brand and
corporate identity have immeasurable value; their utility increases each time
it they are presented properly and decreases with every incorrect or improper
application. Brand attributes define OpenGuides, and accurate and consistent use
of our trademarks is vital to protect the OpenGuides corporate identity. When
it is presented consistently, we create a positive and lasting impression of our
company. It is your responsibility to comply with the most current version of
these guidelines.

<p>
Just kidding.
</p>
<p>
In reality, we have a pretty relaxed approach to the application of the
OpenGuides name. It can be summed up as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you set up a city guide and would like to be part of our
guide network, please link to openguides.org from your site's front page.
Using the words "the OpenGuides network" somewhere would be ideal. It
doesn't have to be called "the Open Guide to Wherever"; you can name it
whatever you like.</li>
	<li>It's "OpenGuides" for the project name, but "The Open Guide
to..." when it comes to naming Guides. Or you could say "OpenGuides
Townsville" (for example) if you like; but not "The OpenGuide to
Townsville".</li>
	<li>If you're using our software for another purpose, please mention on 
the front page that your site's powered by OpenGuides, and have a link to us.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That's it.
