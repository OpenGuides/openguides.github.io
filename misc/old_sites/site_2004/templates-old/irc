<h1>#OpenGuides IRC</h1>
<p>
Most of the OpenGuides developers can be found on <acronym title="Internet 
Relay Chat">IRC</acronym> on a regular basis. We have our own channel, where you 
can drop by and discuss features or get help with things if you need it. Here
are the details:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Network:</b> irc.perl.org</li>
  <li><b>Channel:</b> #OpenGuides</li>
  <li><b>Logs:</b> <a
href="http://openguides.org/irc/logs/">http://openguides.org/irc/logs/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope to see you there! Please note, most people on-channel tend to be in the UK, 
so it might be very quiet from midnight-8am UTC or so.
</p>
<h2>Utility bots for #OpenGuides</h2>
<h3>oglog</h3>
<p>
This bot sits quietly and produces the channel logfiles. If you don't want
it to record what you're saying, start your comment with "[off]" (without
the quotes).
</p>
<h3>pasty</h3>
<p>
If you need to display a block of code, or maybe part of an error log, or similar,
please don't paste it directly into the channel! We have a facility called
<a href="http://paste.husk.org/">pasty</a> that lets you create temporary
webpages with pasted material, so please <a href="http://paste.husk.org/">use
it</a> instead. Remember to select #OpenGuides to paste to from the form,
and <em>pasty</em> the bot will announce to the channel a URL where your
pasted material can be viewed.
</p>
<h3>hel</h3>
<p>
<em>hel</em> announces any new releases that are made of OpenGuides or CGI::Wiki
modules to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</a>.
