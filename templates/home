<h1>What it's about.</h1>
<p>
<strong>OpenGuides&trade;</strong> is a network of free, community-maintained
<a href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">wiki</a> guidebooks to places
around the world. Anyone is free to contribute, whether it's by writing new
articles or editing the articles that we already have. Read more at the <a 
href="/page/information">project</a> page.
</p>
<h2>Software that works.</h2>
<p>
We built our own software engine to do exactly what we wanted to do. You can
read all about it in the <a href="/page/software">software</a> section of this
site. And it's free and open, so you can use and extend it yourself.
</p>
<p>
Here comes the science bit: our technical policy is to provide the maximum 
possible amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">metadata</a> 
about the stuff in our guides in <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><acronym 
title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym></a>, in order to allow it
to be easily integrated into other systems as part of the <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>. What that means to you
and me is that the information our users provide can be shared and re-used
automatically between other sites and technologies.
</p>

The OpenGuides network needs you. We're always looking for more places to
